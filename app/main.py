st.markdown("""
Welcome to the Drug-Gene Interaction CDSS. This tool uses a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of interaction between a specified drug and a gene.

**ðŸ‘ˆ Select a page from the sidebar to get started:**

- **Single Prediction**: Predict the interaction for a single drug-gene pair.
- **Batch Analysis**: Upload a file with multiple pairs for analysis.
- **3D Visualization**: View the 3D molecular structures used by the model.
- **Model Explanation**: Understand which features are most important for a prediction.

This system is for research purposes only and should not be used for clinical decision-making.
